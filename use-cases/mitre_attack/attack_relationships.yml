  notes:
  - This event indicates that a logon process has registered with the Local Security
    Authority (LSA).
  - At the technical level, the event does not come from the registration of a trusted
    logon process, but from a confirmation that the process is a trusted logon process.
    If it is a trusted logon process, the event generates.
